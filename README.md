# BaroStackGen
This script generates a fully-fledged mod for Barotrauma, which increases the stack size of all stackable items to a set value (63 by default).

To generate correct output, the script needs to be run inside the /Content/Items directory in the game files or (preferably) in a backup copy of that folder.
